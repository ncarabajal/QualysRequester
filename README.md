# QualysRequester

QualysRequester is used to download reports from Qualys via their API by report name. This script allows for the user to pass arguments by setting flags and specifying a file path for their download(s). 

## Options

To specify the report or reports the user must enter a full name or partial name in the config file. The user should only specify one and leave the other option blank. 

--help : Simple help menu <br/>
-o : Specify the file path for the output. At the moment the absolute path must be used.
