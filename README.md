# QualysRequester

QualysRequester is used to download reports from Qualys via API by report name. This script allows for the user to pass arguements via flags and specify a file path for their download(s). 

## Options

To specify the report or reports, the user must change the string in line 143. I will fix since it is not the best case. This will change in the future when I get better at programming. 

--help : Simple help menu <br/>
-o : Specify the file path for the output. At the moment the absolute path must be used. 

If there is any feedback or suggestions please feel free to me or the original author [@fragtastic]( https://github.com/fragtastic )`
