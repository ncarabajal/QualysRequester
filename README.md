# QualysRequester

QualysRequester is used to download reports from Qualys via their API by report name. This script allows for the user to pass arguments setting flags and specify a file path for their download(s). 

## Options

To specify the report or reports, the user must change the string in line 143. I will fix this since it is not the best case. I just currently suck at programming right now.  

--help : Simple help menu <br/>
-o : Specify the file path for the output. At the moment the absolute path must be used. 

If there is any feedback or suggestions please feel free to reach out to me or the original author [@fragtastic]( https://github.com/fragtastic )
