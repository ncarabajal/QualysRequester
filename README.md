# QualysRequester

QualysRequester is used to download reports from Qualys via API by report name. This script allows for the user to pass arguements via flags and specify a file path for their download(s). 

## Options

To specify the report or reports, the user must change the string in line 143. I will fix since it is not the best case. This will change in the future when I get better at programming. 

--help : Simple help menu <br/>
-o : Specify the file path for the output. At the moment the absolute path must be used. 

If there is any feedback or suggestions please feel free to
